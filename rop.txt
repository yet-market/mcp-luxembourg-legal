here where we stoped in last sessions : ok now there is some trasnaformation we need to do
  cause the result of the sparql quesy is a
    link that we nned to trsnaform and fetch to return the result !  dont code just tell me how
    we do that how we give mco all the queryies possible and attribute and how to transaform
  data
     also

  ⏺ Excellent point! You need to transform raw SPARQL results into meaningful data for the AI.
    Here's how this works:

    🔄 Data Transformation Strategy:

    The Problem:

    - SPARQL returns URIs/links like http://data.legilux.public.lu/resource/law/123
    - AI needs human-readable content like actual law text, company names, descriptions
    - Raw SPARQL results are often just IDs and references

    The Solution - Multi-Step Process:

    1. Execute initial SPARQL query (gets the URIs/IDs)
    2. Follow the links to get detailed content
    3. Transform and enrich the data
    4. Return structured, readable results to the AI

    🛠️ MCP Server Enhancement Strategy:

    Enhanced Tool Design:

    Instead of just a simple query tool, you need intelligent tools that:

    1. Domain-Specific Tools:

    - search_laws - Finds and fetches complete law documents
    - search_companies - Gets full company profiles with details
    - search_regulations - Returns regulation text, not just references
    - get_entity_details - Follows any URI to get complete information

    2. Smart Query Templates:

    Pre-built SPARQL patterns for common tasks:
    - Law search pattern: Gets title, content, date, status, amendments
    - Company search pattern: Gets name, address, directors, activities
    - Geographic pattern: Gets locations with coordinates, descriptions

    3. Data Enrichment Pipeline:

    - Step 1: Execute SPARQL query (gets basic results)
    - Step 2: Identify URIs that need dereferencing
    - Step 3: Fetch additional content from each URI
    - Step 4: Combine and structure all data
    - Step 5: Return enriched, human-readable results

    🧠 AI Discovery Strategy:

    Tool Descriptions That Teach:

    Each MCP tool tells the AI exactly what it can do:

    {
      "name": "search_laws",
      "description": "Search Luxembourg laws by topic, keyword, or date. Returns complete law
    text, not just references.",
      "parameters": {
        "query": "Natural language search terms (e.g., 'tax laws', 'company registration')",
        "date_from": "Optional: Search laws from this date",
        "include_content": "Whether to include full text (default: true)"
      }
    }

    Schema Discovery:

    Your MCP server can expose:
    - Available data types (laws, companies, locations, etc.)
    - Searchable attributes (title, content, date, category)
    - Relationship types (law amendments, company subsidiaries)
    - Data structure examples (what results look like)

    🎯 Intelligent Query Construction:

    The AI Learns:

    - What data exists: "Luxembourg has laws, company registries, geographic data"
    - How to search: "Use search_laws for legal queries, search_companies for business"
    - What results look like: "Results include full text, metadata, relationships"
    - How to follow up: "Can get details on any entity found"

    Smart Patterns:

    - User: "Show me tax laws"
    - AI: Uses search_laws tool with topic="tax"
    - Your server:
      a. Queries SPARQL for tax-related laws
      b. Fetches full text for each law found
      c. Extracts key information (dates, amendments, status)
      d. Returns structured, readable results

    📚 Content Transformation Types:

    URI Resolution:

    - http://data.legilux.public.lu/resource/law/123 → Full law document with title, text,
    metadata

    Reference Expansion:

    - Law references → Include referenced law titles and summaries
    - Company IDs → Include company names, addresses, activities
    - Geographic codes → Include place names, coordinates, descriptions

    Data Enrichment:

    - Legal documents: Add summaries, key points, related laws
    - Companies: Add industry classification, size, recent filings
    - Locations: Add administrative details, coordinates, hierarchies

    🌟 Advanced Capabilities:

    Semantic Understanding:

    - Detect entity types in SPARQL results
    - Automatically choose appropriate transformation strategy
    - Build relationships between different data types
    - Provide context for better AI understanding

    Query Optimization:

    - Cache frequently accessed entity details
    - Batch URI resolution for efficiency
    - Provide query suggestions based on available data
    - Handle complex multi-step queries automatically

    🎁 End Result:

    User Experience:

    - User: "What are the environmental regulations for companies in Luxembourg?"
    - AI: Gets comprehensive answer with:
      - Actual regulation text (not just links)
      - Applicable company types
      - Implementation dates
      - Compliance requirements
      - Related penalties

    AI Capabilities:

    - Understands Luxembourg data structure
    - Constructs appropriate queries automatically
    - Provides rich, contextual answers
    - Follows up with related information

    Your MCP server becomes an intelligent gateway that transforms raw government data into
    AI-digestible knowledge! 🇱🇺🧠✨

    The key is building transformation logic that turns links and IDs into meaningful,
  contextual
     information the AI can work with naturally.

  > how would we do that knowing that as a hman i do :
    : this query replacing taxe with any keyword im looking for PREFIX jolux:
    <http://data.legilux.public.lu/resource/ontology/jolux#>
    PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

    SELECT ?date ?title
    WHERE
    {
        ?act jolux:dateDocument ?date;
             jolux:isRealizedBy ?expression .
        ?expression jolux:title ?title .
      FILTER(regex(str(?title), 'taxe'^^xsd:string))
    }

    than in the result i see entity attribute on each  row of result and add to the link
  /fr/html
     if there is content i take body tag content if not i do the same link but downlod with
    accept pdf  and add /fr/pdf to the link and extract pdf content


    dont code jsut tell me
